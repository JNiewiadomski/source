Parallel Digital Interface
--------------------------
The software/hardware solution for the high speed input tests will consist
of a very high speed data aquisition card that interfaces to a PC/AT and a
compiler that will translate high level instructions to a test pattern that
will be transmitted through the data aquisition board to the units being
tested.


Hardware
--------
PDMA-32 Very High Speed Parallel Digital Interface Board

The PDMA-32 is a high speed 16 bit digital input/output board for the
IBM PC/AT only.  The board has 8 or 16 bit direct memory access	(DMA).  It is
intended for applications requiring high speed digital memory transfers to
and/or from external computers and peripheral devices.  The PDMA-32 uses the
full 16-bit data bus available in "AT" type computers, effectively doubling
the transfer rate of the PC/XT.  Data transfers of up to 200,000 words
(16-bit) per second can be accomplished in either input or output modes.  All
high speed data transfers are performed under DMA (Direct Memory Access)
control.

The PDMA-32 provides 2 eight bit ports.  Each can be set as an input or
output while the board is under software control, and each of the ports can
be addressed as normal I/O locations.  However, when operating the board in
high speed mode (under DMA control) both I/O ports must be set to operate in
the same direction.


Software
--------
The software will be in the form of a compiler.  The tester will create a
source file using a text editor.  The source file will describe the set of
output patterns that will be transfered by the PDMA-32 to the test unit.  An
optional set of input patterns will allow the output patterns to be changed
dynamically either by the user via the keyboard or an external signal via the
input port.  The compiler will check the source file for syntax and semantic
errors.  If any errors are detected, the compiler will identify the line on
which the error occurred and a short description explaining the reason why an
error exists.  If no errors are detected, the compiler will optionally begin
driving the PDMA-32 data aquisition board with the test data.


Qualitative Requirements
------------------------

I.  Degree of Functionality
---------------------------
The following is a list of commands and options that the compiler will
provide:
	.INCLUDE	Allows separate source files to be created and used
			as interchangeable libraries.

	.DEVICE		Accesses board specific functionality, such as clock
			speed and port direction.  This is the link between
			the user and the hardware that provides for future
			expandability.

	.TEXT		Help messages and prompts are defined and labeled.

	.STATE		Input patterns are specified.  This enables an
			external stimulus to be recognized and cause a new
			action to be performed.

	.ACTION		Output patterns that will be cyclically generated.

	.CASE		Definitions of cause-effect relationships of states
			and actions.

	.STARTUP	Initial sequence of actions to be performed.
