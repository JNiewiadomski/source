The Problem
-----------
The inability to fully verify the correct performance of new and existing
counters and displays (units) when subjected to high speed input.


What
----
A software/hardware solution is needed to subject units to predefined high
speed input tests so that the integrity and correct functionality of the unit
may be verified.


Why
---
When new displays and counters are designed and manufactured, the units are
tested for noise immunity, tolerance to large shifts in temperature and
for correct functionality in every day use.  Unfortunately, there is no way
of testing the hardware to verify that they can perform as stated when
subjected to high speed input signals.  This can lead to producing hardware
that may possibly malfunction when used in the real world.


Scope
-----
The software/hardware solution needs to subject the units to a fast stream of
input signals to verify that the units perform as expected.  The user needs
to be able to define the stream of data that will be input to the unit as
well as the speed at which the signals will change.  There needs to be a way
to save the test data so that it can be repeated at some future point in
time.  In this way, the new version of the unit can be subjected to the same
tests that the previous version of the design had passed.
