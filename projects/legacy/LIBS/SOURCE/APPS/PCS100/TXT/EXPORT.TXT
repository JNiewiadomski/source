The ability to provide a standardized ASCII format file of archival data that
dBase III, Excel and other second source programs understand.

Most second source programs that import data have the ability to read in
ASCII text files of the format:

	<field_1> <field_delimeter>
	<field_2> <field_delimeter>
	...
	<field_n> <record_delimeter>
		
where <field_delimeter> and <record_delimeter> are ASCII characters which are
used to separate individual records and fields within those records.

The PCS100 software will provide the ability to save archival data of open
and closed jobs using this format.  The <field_delimeter> and
<record_delimeter> characters are user definable.  The Job menu will contain
two more commands which provide the ability to export open and closed jobs
and shifts.
