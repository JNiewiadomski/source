ATTENTION:  The following text describes the changes that will be made to the
PCS100 software for the IBM PC and IBM PS/2 microcomputers and compatibles.
These changes are being made as a result of Herr Bressert's request dated
July 10, 1990.

A)	The ability to change the colors of the menus and windows.

	The colors can only be changed through the resource description
	document.  The resource description document is a text file that
	provides the data that the PCS100 software requires to run.  Parts of
	the data within this document inform the PCS100 software which colors
	to use when displaying data on the screen.  Change these color
	specifiers to the colors desired.

	The data within the resource description document is not immediately
	understood by the PCS100 software.  A tool called SRC (Symbolic
	Resource Compiler) is needed to convert the data into a form that the
	PCS100 software understands.  This compiler will be provided together
	with the updated PCS100 software.

B)	The ability to provide a standardized ASCII format file of archival
	data that dBase III, Excel and other second source programs
	understand.

	Most second source programs that import data have the ability to read
	in ASCII text files of the format:

		<field_1> <field_delimeter>
		<field_2> <field_delimeter>
		...
		<field_n> <record_delimeter>
		
	where <field_delimeter> and <record_delimeter> are ASCII characters
	which are used to separate individual records and fields within those
	records.

	The PCS100 software will provide the ability to save archival data of
	open and closed jobs using this format.  The <field_delimeter> and
	<record_delimeter> characters are user definable.  The Job menu will
	contain two more commands which provide the ability to export open
	and closed jobs and shifts.

C)	The ability to make translation changes to the PCS100 software.

	Source text files will be provided of the English and German versions
	of the PCS100 software, as well as the Symbolic Resource Compiler
	tool described in point A.  Structured changes can be made to the
	text file and compiled.  The files generated by the compiler will
	replace the resource files provided.

ADDENDUM:  If changes are made to the PCS100.GR, PCS100.US, SEASHELL.GR, or
SEASHELL.US files, they must be compiled with the provided SRC program.  The
syntax is as follows:

			SRC PCS100.GR PCS100.049
			SRC PCS100.US PCS100.RES
