This document explains how to translate text between languages.

Blocks of text are separated by dashed lines spanning width of page.
Error messages are restricted to 50 characters in length.
Help text is restricted to 76 characters per line.
Menu names are restricted to 20 characters in length.
Menu items are restricted to 50 characters in length.
String messages are restricted to 80 characters in length.

Note that there is a maximum total length of menu names.  That is:
  ä(menu name length) + ((# of menu names - 1) * 2) < 79

Where appropriate, a key sequence has been provided to help translator
understand how text should be translated by seeing it on the screen of a
personal computer running the PCS100 software.  These key sequences do not
need to be translated.

The screen label positions must be maintained.  In general, the white space
to the left of the text can be utilized.

The strings "Running", "Idle", "Setup", "Printing", "Bad Data", "Updating",
"Off-line", and "Unknown" are restricted to 10 characters in length.
The strings "Kicker", "Feed", and "None" are restricted to 6 characters in
length.

Major sections are separated by a dashed line running across the page.
At the start of each section is a label beginning with '*****' which
identifies what type of text follows.  These labels do not need to be
translated.
