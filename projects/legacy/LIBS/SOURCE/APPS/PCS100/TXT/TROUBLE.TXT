Problem:  Certain characters and/or highlight bar does not display
Solution: The PC is set for color while the monitor is monochrome/gray scale.
          Use the DOS command to change the mode to monochrome.
          Syntax: MODE MONO

Problem:  Unable to save changes to job/machine/operator installation.
Solution: The CONFIG.SYS file on the booting disk must specify a larger
          number of files that can be open concurrently.  Either use the
          command provided on the original PCS100 program diskette, or
          include the following command in the CONFIG.SYS file on your
          booting disk: FILES = 15
