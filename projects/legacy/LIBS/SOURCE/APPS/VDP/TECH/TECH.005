The VDP software does not correctly identify the video configuration on
certain color laptops.  When the VDP software is invoked, it may lock up the
laptop and require cold booting (pressing the reset button or cycling power).

The reason for such violent behavior may have to do with the location of the
laptops' video memory.  If the memory does not reside where the VDP software
expects it to reside, the VDP software will end up writing on potentially
critical areas of the laptops' memory.

The fix for this is simple.  Instruct the customer to use the DOS MODE
to switch the active display adapter to the Monochrome Display Adapter.
The following instruction should be typed at the DOS command line:

				  MODE MONO

Some versions of MS-DOS have a slightly different syntax (eg. MODE MDA).
Have the customer consult the "DOS Operating System Reference" manual for
more details.
