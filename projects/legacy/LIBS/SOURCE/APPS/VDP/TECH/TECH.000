The VDP tech notes attempt to provide help in giving good technical support
for the Vorne Display-Pro Utility software.

When a customer calls due to a problem with the VDP software, attempt to
understand exactly what is wrong before trying to find a solution.  Many
times the caller will not provide enough information about the problem at
hand.  Therefore, a question/answer session should be initiated to determine
the specific nature of the problem.


		     Steps to Take to Resolve a Problem
		     ----------------------------------

Talk to the customer and try to get a feel for what may be the problem.
Perhaps the user simply does not understand what steps are needed to program
the 2000C display.  In this case, "walk through" with the customer step by
step the proper actions needed to accomplish the task the customer wishes to
perform.

If the customer indeed has a problem, get an exact description of the events
that triggered the problem.  This includes any messages or special ID alerts
that may have been displayed when the error occured.  In most cases the
error message will zero in on the problem.

Example Problem:
	The customer is unable to save the small message file that was just
	created.  The program displayed an error message and then just quit.
	The contents of the message file were lost.
Example Solution:
	Immediately suspect that the user has not adequately described all of
	the events that have transpired if it is stated that the program
	"just quit" on its own.  The software was designed to display a
	message whenever an error occurs with prompts from the user to press
	one of several keys.

	In this case, when the user was asked to read exactly what the error
	message displayed, the answer was obvious:
		      "Write-protected Diskette"
	Have the user take out the diskette from the drive, take off the
	write-protection tab, reinsert the diskette into the drive and press
	the 'R' key to retry the operation (a list of the available options
	is displayed on the screen).


If there is no error message or the error message does not suggest a reason
for the users problem, attempt to determine the specific environment that
the user is using.  The environment includes:

	The version number of the VDP software.

	The name and version number of the operating system that the user is
	using (for example: PC-DOS v3.30 or MS-DOS v4.01, ...).

	The type of microcomputer that the user is using, including:
		- name of the manufacturer
		- PC model number
		- type of monitor and graphics card (MDA, CGA, EGA, VGA, ...)
		- list of all drives and their sizes (20 MB hard drive,
		  720 MB 3« floppy drive, 360 KB 5¬ floppy drive, ...)
		- number of serial ports

	Any out-of-the-ordinary hardware attached to the system (networks,
	accelerators, ...)

	The type of 2000C display that the user is attempting to program.  It
	can be either a 250 message or 64 message display (yes, 64 message
	units are still out there).

	If a critical error message was displayed, note the full error
	message text and the six character code in the upper right hand
	corner of the window.

All of this information should provide a clue as to what is wrong.  By
process of elimination narrow down the scope of the problem.

The following is a list of released tech notes.
