  Topic : Timing Problems when Programming the 2000C Display

Versions of the VDP software prior to v2.0.5 at times exhibit problems when
attempting to program the 2000C displays.  Symptoms include incorrect
messages messages being programmed and incorrect chain linking options being
programmed.

The fix for this problem is simple: change the values in the Timing dialog.
For v2.0 and above, the timing dialog box is accessed via the SYSTEM menu.
Instruct the user to open the hidden SYSTEM menu by holding down the <Alt>
key (the left <Alt> key on 101 keyboards) and press the <1> key.  Choosing
the TIMING command will display the Timing dialog box.  For users of the
v1.0 software, the Timing command is located in the HELP menu.

Increasing the values in the timing dialog box will increase the delay
between characters transmitted to the 2000C display.  The values should be
increased by 1 cS (1 centisecond equals 10 milliseconds) increments.  Some
versions of the software give the false illusion that the timing can be
changed by mS's.  This is not the case.


		Explanation of Why the Timing is so Critical
		--------------------------------------------

The 2000C display was originally designed to be programmed by a dumb
terminal or an RCA keyboard.  This means that the 2000C display is
programmed one character at a time.  Since a user can only type so fast, the
2000C display was able to service each and every character received.

To add a convenience to the user of the 2000C display, the VDP software had
been developed to provide a convenient way to edit, save, recall, modify and
serially transmit messages.

The user is presented with the illusion that the VDP software communicates
with the 2000C display.  In reality, the computer is transmitting characters
to the 2000C display just as the dumb terminal and RCA keyboard.  There is
no two-way communication between the PC and the 2000C.

Since the PC can transmit characters to the 2000C at full speed, a problem
had been encountered.  The 2000C display needs a finite amount of time to
process each character and act on it.  Thus the concept of timing had been
introduced.

Initially there were two delays: the delay between characters and the delay
between messages.  Since the 2000C needs more time to save a message in
nonvolatile memory, the VDP software needed to wait longer when an entire
message was being saved.  Through empirical testing an optimal set of timing
delays have been found and used when programming the 2000C display.  The 2.0
and later versions of the VDP software tried to increase throughput by
introducing a third timing value: chain-link.  More time is needed to
program the chain links than when programming the rest of the options in the
display.  Since most messages do not use chain linking, an efficient
optimization was to only delay longer when programming the chain linking.

Unfortunately, not all of the permutations can be realistically found and
from time to time an unforseen combination causes the VDP software to send
faster serially than the 2000C can handle.  Thus, characters are lost and
messages get programmed incorrectly.


			   On 64 Message Displays
			   ----------------------

Notice that the latest version of the VDP software, v2.0.5, no longer
supports the 64 message display.  Before suspecting a timing problem, verify
that the user is not trying to program a 64 message display with software
that only programs 250 message units (or older 64 message mode software
trying to program 250 message units).

If a user has a 64 message display, make sure that the customer receives the
2.0.4 version of the VDP software.
