The VDP software sometimes does not display reverse video correctly on some
laptops and compatibles with monochrome monitors.  The reason for this is due
to the computer not being in the correct display mode.

The original PC treats reverse video differently then the later PC's.  The
VDP software tries to display colors correctly on the screen by looking at
the current display mode and using the appropriate color attributes.  This is
apparent when the current display mode is not set up correctly.

The fix for this is simple.  Instruct the customer to use the DOS MODE
to switch the active display adapter to the Monochrome Display Adapter.
The following instruction should be typed at the DOS command line:

				  MODE MONO

Some versions of MS-DOS have a slightly different syntax (eg. MODE MDA).
Have the customer consult the "DOS Operating System Reference" manual for
more details.
