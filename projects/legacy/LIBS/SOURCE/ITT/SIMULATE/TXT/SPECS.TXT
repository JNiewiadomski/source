ITT O/I Panel  -  December 27, 1989  -  v1.0.3
----------------------------------------------

1.0  The Physical Layer
-----------------------

The Physical Layer provides a physical link between the P.L.C. and the
O/I Panel.

The Physical Layer uses an electrically isolated RS-422 / RS-485 interface.
The data format is set at either 1200 or 9600 Baud, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit,
no parity.


1.1  Connections from PC or PS/2 to master P.L.C.
-------------------------------------------------

The PC or PS/2 has a D-shell 25 pin male RS-232C serial communications
connector.  The unbalanced full-duplex RS-232C signals must be converted to
balanced half-duplex RS-485 signals (RS-485 is an enhanced version of the
RS-422 balanced line standard.  It allows multiple drivers and receivers on
a two wire system).

This conversion may be accomplished by using the B&B RS-232C to RS-485
Converter.  The RS-232C port uses a female DB-25S type connector and the
RS-485 port uses a male DB-25P type connector.  RTS must be off (low or
marking) to receive and on (high or spacing) to transmit.  The pin
assignments are as follows:

Female DB-25S Connector (RS-232C)             Male DB-25P Connector (RS-485)
---------------------------------             ------------------------------

2 - Transmit Data (TD)                         2 (A) - Send Data + (SD+)
3 - Receive Data (RD)                          5 (A) - Receive Data + (RD+)
4 - Request To Send (RTS)                      7     - Signal Ground (SG)
7 - Signal Ground                             14 (B) - Send Data - (SD-)
                                              17 (B) - Receive Data - (RD-)

NOTE: The B&B RS-232C to RS-485 Converter uses RTS to change the flow of data.
      Specifically, RTS must be off (low or marking) to receive and on (high
      or spacing) to transmit.

The P.L.C. has a 10 pin male Phoenix connector with RS-485 signals.  The pin
assignments are as follows:

0 - Transmit Data - (TxD-)
1 - Transmit Data + (TxD+)
2 - Receive Data - (RxD-)
3 - Receive Data + (RxD+)
4 - Ground (Gnd)
5 - Ground (Gnd)
6 - Transmit Data - (TxD-)
7 - Transmit Data + (TxD+)
8 - Receive Data - (RxD-)
9 - Receive Data + (RxD+)

The two systems may be wired together for serial communications as follows:

DB-25 Female                                 10 pin female Phoenix

  (RD-) - 17     ---+---------------+---     9 - Receive Data + (RxD+)


2.0  The Data Link Layer
------------------------

The Data Link Layer provides for an error free transmission.  All error
detection and correction is handled at this level.

The Data Link Data Packet has the following format:

Byte  1      : STX (0x02) - Indication for start of Data Link Data Packet.
               If an STX character occurs in the Network Data Packet, a
               NUL (0x00) character will be byte stuffed immediately
               afterward.  This NUL character is not included in the
               length nor used to compute the checksum.
Byte  2      : Packet Length d of all characters in Data Link Data Packet,
               including STX and Check Sum.
Byte  3      : Node number of the station (ranges from 0x11 to 0x1F).
Byte  4      : Index.  Bit 7 (most significant bit) is the error indicator.
               If bit 7 is set (1), it indicates that the Index byte is
               used as an error or status message:
                       1100 0000 (0xC0) - reset done
                       1100 0001 (0xC1) - index error
                       1100 1000 (0xC8) - instruction done
               If bit 7 is clear (0), bits 0 through 5 contain the index
               number.  Bit 6 is always 1.  
Bytes 5..d-1 : Network Data Packet from the Network Layer
Byte  d      : Check Sum.  If the Check Sum is 0x02 (STX), all bits in the
               Check Sum are inverted.  The Check Sum is computed as
               follows (data points to data packet, len holds data packet
               length):
                             mov chk,#$00     ; initialize check sum
                       loop: asl chk          ; shift old check sum left
                             adc chk,[data]   ; add character to check sum, using possible carry from shift
                             adc chk,#$00     ; add in carry
                             inc data         ; point to next character
                             dec len          ; we did one character
                             bne loop         ; any more characters?
                             cmp chk,#$02     ; is check sum STX?
                             bne quit         ; if not, we're done
                             mov chk,#$FD     ; negate check sum
                       quit: rts              ; that's all, folks


2.0.1  Internal Index
---------------------

The O/I Panel keeps an Internal Index, which is initialized to 0x41 (bit 6
of the index is always set).  The previous index number is kept in the
Previous Internal Index, which is used to detect Instruction Done errors
{section 2.1.4} where a response was sent by the O/I Panel but never received
by the P.L.C.  The Previous Internal Index is initialized to 0x00.


2.1  Receiving Data
-------------------

On receipt of the Data Link Data Packet, a few data integrity checks must be
performed.


2.1.1  Node Number
------------------

If the Node does not match the O/I Panel's node number, then the data packet
is ignored.


2.1.2  Check Sum
----------------

If the Check Sum does not match the check sum that we computed on the data
received {section 2.0}, then the data packet is ignored.


2.1.2.1  STX Characters within the Data Link Data Packet
--------------------------------------------------------

Note that the Check Sum algorithm in {section 2.0} assumes that all NUL
characters following a STX character have been stripped out upon receipt
(this relies upon the notion that the NUL stuffing/extracting should be
handled right when the characters are written/read from the UART).  If the
character following an STX character is not a NUL, it will be assumed to be
the Packet Length.  The preceding STX will be used as a resynchronization
character denoting the new beginning of a new Data Link Data packet.  Any
other data accumulated prior to the STX will be ignored.


2.1.3  Reset Command
--------------------

If the first byte of the Network Data Packet is the ESC (0x1B) character and
the second byte is a RESET (0x52, 'R') request, the O/I Panel must
reset the Previous Internal Index is set to 0x00, and the Internal Index is
set to 0x41.  A status is reported back to the P.L.C. by sending a packet
with the Index value of 0xC0 (reset done).

Byte 1 : STX (0x02)
Byte 2 : Packet Length of 7
Byte 3 : Node number of the station (ranges from 0x11 to 0x1F)
Byte 4 : Internal Index.  Bit 6 is always 1.  Bit 7 is always 0.
Byte 5 : ESC (0x1B)
Byte 6 : RESET (0x52, 'R')
Byte 7 : Check Sum {section 2.0}


2.1.4  Instruction Done
-----------------------

If the Index matches the Previous Internal Index value {section 2.0.1}, an
error is reported back to the P.L.C. by sending a packet with the Index value
of 0xC8 (instruction done).


2.1.5  Index Error
------------------

If the Index does not match the Internal Index of the O/I Panel, an error
is reported back to the P.L.C. by sending a packet with the Index value
of 0xC1 (index error).


2.1.6  Valid Data Link Data Packet
----------------------------------

Once a valid Data Link Data Packet is received, the Previous Internal Index
is assigned the value of the Internal Index, and the Internal Index is
incremented (with wrap around).  Remember that bit 6 is always set and bit 7
is used to denote an error or status.  Therefore, the Internal Index value
ranges from 0x40 to 0x7F.

An example sequence would be:
  0x41, 0x42, 0x43, ..., 0x7D, 0x7E, 0x7F, 0x40, 0x41, 0x42, ...


2.2  Transmiting Data
---------------------

There are two types of transmissions, and both are a direct result of a poll
from the P.L.C.  The O/I Panel is not allowed to begin a transmission
on its own.


2.2.1  Acknowledgement With No Data Requested by P.L.C. (Write)
---------------------------------------------------------------

The ACK is always initiated by the Network Layer {section 3.1}.

A single ACK (0x06) character is transmitted to the P.L.C. to indicate a
successful receipt by O/I Panel.  Note that only one character is
transmitted; it is not encapsulated within a Data Link Data Packet.  This is
done for two reasons: low overhead and fast acknowledgement.  If the ACK
character is somehow lost, the P.L.C. will eventually re-transmit the same
data packet.  Since it is only one character in length, the probability of
an error in transmission is very small.


2.2.2  Data Requested by P.L.C. (Read)
--------------------------------------

All error, status, or data requests are transmitted to the P.L.C. by
encapsulating the Network Data Packet within the Data Link Data Packet.


2.2.2.1  Error Or Status Reply
------------------------------

All Error and Status replies are initiated by the Data Link Layer
{sections 2.1.3, 2.1.4, 2.1.5}.

For an error or a status, the Length will be 6.  The Node will be BROADCAST
(0x10).  The index will have the error bit (bit 7) set, bit 6 set, and bits
0 through 5 indicating the error or status.  The first byte of the Network
Data Packet will be the MASTER (0x80) character.  The Check Sum will be
computed as described in {section 2.0}.

Byte  1 : STX (0x02)
Byte  2 : Packet Length of 6
Byte  3 : Node number is BROADCAST (0x10)
Byte  4 : Index.  Bit 7 (most significant bit) is the error indicator.
                  1100 0000 (0xC0) - reset done
                  1100 0001 (0xC1) - index error
                  1100 1000 (0xC8) - instruction done
Byte  5 : Network Data Packet is MASTER (0x80)
Byte  6 : Check Sum {section 2.0}


2.2.2.2  Reply (Read)
---------------------

All Read Replies are initiated by the Network Layer {section 3.2}.

The Length will be the total Data Link Packet length, including the STX and
Check Sum.  The Node will be BROADCAST (0x10).  Index will be set to the
Internal Index number.  The first byte of the Network Data Packet will be
the MASTER (0x80) character.  The bytes following will be the data received
from the Network layer.  The Check Sum will be computed as described in
{section 2.0}.

Byte  1      : STX (0x02)
Byte  2      : Packet Length d of all characters in Data Link Data Packet,
               including STX and Check Sum.
Byte  3      : BROADCAST (0x10)
Byte  4      : Internal Index.  Bit 6 is always 1.  Bit 7 is always 0.
Byte  5      : MASTER (0x80)
Bytes 6..d-1 : Network Data Packet from the Network Layer
Byte  d      : Check Sum {section 2.0}.


3.0  The Network Layer
----------------------

The Network Layer provides an error free connection between the P.L.C. and
the O/I Panel.

The received Network Data Packet has the following format:

Byte  1        : Command: 0x00 is WRITE, 0x01 is READ
Byte  2        : Length n bytes to WRITE or READ
Byte  3        : High Byte of Starting Address
Byte  4        : Low Byte of Starting Address
Bytes 5..5+n-1 : Data


3.1  Write Request
------------------

A request to WRITE copies the Data received into the O/I Panel's memory,
starting at the Address specified.  An ACK is transmitted to notify the
P.L.C. that the WRITE has been performed {section 2.2.1}.


3.2  Read Request
-----------------

A request to READ transmits the O/I Panel's memory, starting at the
Address specified to the P.L.C.  The Network Packet consists solely of the
data that was requested to be READ {section 2.2.2.2}.

Byte  1..n : Data read from O/I Panel's memory.
