                       Technologic Pump Controller
                            Operator Interface
                    Technical Reference Manual  v1.0.1
                             January 22, 1990


1.0  -  Hardware
----------------

The Technologic Pump Controller Operator Interface (O/I Panel) has the
following physical characteristics:
  -  17.13 x 5.5 x ??.??
  -  2 by 20 character vaccuum florescent alphanumeric display
  -  2 by 8 switch matrix with bi-colored LED's
  -  3 by 4 switch matrix
  -  1 DB-9 RS-485 serial port
  -  1 power cord


2.0  -  Operation
-----------------

The O/I Panel processes all I/O (Input/Output) between a machine operator and
a P.L.C.  The O/I Panel is always polled by the P.L.C. and never initiates
communication on its own.  The O/I Panel is capable of maintaining an error
free serial link with the P.L.C, filtering out invalid key strokes from the
machine operator, displaying volatile data, error conditions, alarms, and
causing the LED's to show one of two colors either continually on or
flashing.


2.1  -  Power Up
----------------

On power up, the O/I Panel displays a corporate signiature and does a self
test.  Internally, all of the registers in the Master Communications Table
(MCT), from R1300 to 1779, are cleared (set to 0) in the O/I Panel.


2.1.1  -  Corporate Signiature  [C.2]
-------------------------------------

On power up, the O/I Panel displays the following corporate signiature:

" ITT Bell & Gossett "
"  Powersav System   "

"    Technologic     "
"  Pump Controller   "

"   Copyright 1989   "
"All Rights Reserved "


2.1.2  -  Self Test  [C.2][C.8]
-------------------------------

Following the corporate signiature, a hardware self test is conducted to
determine the quality of the unit.  All of the segments of the 2 line display
are turned on, both colors of the LED's are turned on and flashed, and the
entire character set of the O/I Panel is scrolled on the display.


2.2  -  Main Operation
----------------------

Once the corporate signiature has been displayed and the self test run, the
O/I Panel continually monitors the status of communication with the P.L.C,
detects alarm conditions, updates the display and the LED's, and processes
key presses.

In general, a message that is greater than 20 characters is scrolled across
the display on the same line.


2.2.1  -  Off-Line  [A.2-1][E.2-1]
----------------------------------

If the O/I Panel is not polled within a 5 second time frame, the O/I Panel is
considered to be Off-Line and the following error message is displayed:

"Communication Failed"
"O/I interface not communicating with P.L.C.; call factory for help"

This message persists for as long as there is no communication from the
P.L.C.


2.2.2  -  In-Error
------------------

If the O/I Panel is being polled by the P.L.C. but the commands are
continually not recognized for 5 seconds, the O/I Panel is considered to be
In-Error and the following error message is displayed:

"Communication Error "
"O/I interface receiving invalid commands from P.L.C.; call factory for help"

This message persists for as long as invalid commands are being received.


2.2.3  -  On-Line
-----------------

If the O/I Panel is being polled and is receiving valid commands, the O/I
Panel is considered to be On-Line.


2.2.3.1  -  Alarms
------------------

If any of the bits in the alarm registers is set (to 1), an alarm condition
is in effect.

R1732  -  Remote-Local-Off Switch in 'OFF' [D.6]
R1744  -  Pump Failure  [D.9]
R1746  -  Remote Start and Power Failure  [D.10]
R1748  -  Zone Failure  [D.7]
R1750  -  Transmitter Miscalibration  [D.8]
R1752  -  Flow and KW Failure  [D.11]

If an alarm condition is detected and the O/I Panel is not in the middle of
an operation (ie. HAND, PROCESS VARIABLE, SET POINT, ALTERNATION, TEST or
SET UP) the following message is flashed on line 2:

"* * *  ALARM  * * * "

If the HELP key is pressed when an alarm condition exists, the following
short help message is displayed:

"   Alarm YY of XX   "  -  YY indicates current, XX indicates total
"short help message  "  -  help text pertaining to current alarm

Pressing the HELP key again will display the short help message on line 1
and a longer help message is scrolled on line 2.

"short help message  "  [E.2-1]
"long help message   "

The following state table describes the operation of the help system:

YY = 0, which means that the first alarm found is the current alarm displayed
XX = total number of alarms found
state = short help

Hey Pressed   Action Taken  [E.1]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
CLEAR         if state == long help, state = short help, else exit help
DOWN          YY = next alarm with wrap around
HELP          if state == short help, state = long help
UP            YY = previous alarm with wrap around


2.2.3.2  -  No User Data  [D.6]
-------------------------------

If no alarm condition exists, bit 10 of the Keypad Flag Write Register (R1732)
must be tested to determine whether or not the machine operator has set up
the system correctly.  The P.L.C. will determine this condition for us.
Since the P.L.C. has memory backed up by battery, it retains the register
values when power is cycled.  Whenever this bit is 0, the following message
is displayed:

" Please Do 'Setup'  "
"    No User Data    "


2.2.3.3  -  Alternation Engaged  [B.5][D.6]
-------------------------------------------

Whenever bit 0 of the Keypad Flag Write Register (R1732) is 1, the following
message is displayed on line 2:

"Alt Engaged-Stand By"


2.2.3.4  -  Bypass  [C.3-1.3][D.6]
----------------------------------

Whenever bit 2 of the Keypad Flag Write Register (R1732) is 1, the following
message is displayed on line 2:

"System in BYPASS    "


2.2.3.5  -  Manual  [C.3-1.3][D.6]
----------------------------------

Whenever bit 3 of the Keypad Flag Write Register (R1732) is 1, the following
message is displayed on line 2:

"Manual Speed = XXX %"  -  XXX is the speed value in R1690


2.2.3.6  -  Start Up - Stand By  [D.6]
--------------------------------------

Whenever bit 11 of the Keypad Flag Write Register (R1732) is 1, the following
message is displayed on line 2:

"Start Up - Stand By "


2.2.3.7  -  Default Messsages  [C.2]
------------------------------------

Default messages are displayed whenever the O/I Panel is On-Line {2.2.3}
and User Data {2.2.3.2} has been entered.

If an alarm condition is detected {2.2.3.1}, alternation is engaged
{2.2.3.3}, system is in bypass {2.2.3.4} system is in manual {2.2.3.5}, or
system is in start up {2.2.3.6}, only line one is used.  Otherwise, both
lines are utilized for the default messages.
