The Transmit utility sends data over the serial port of a personal computer. 
Use the following syntax to invoke the program:

       Transmit [-2] [-b] [-d] [-h] [-o] [-p] [-r] [-s] [filename...]

-2	Use serial port COM2.  Default is COM1.
-b	Change the Baud rate: 50, 75, 110, 134, 150, 300, 600, 1200, 1800,
	2000, 2400, 3600, 4800, 7200, 9600 or 19200.  Default is 9600.
-d	Change the number of data bits: 5, 6, 7 or 8.  Default is 8.
-h	Display help screen.
-o	Override DOS MODE settings with: 9600 Baud, no parity, 8 data bits
	and 1 stop bit.  If this option is not specified, the current
	settings are used.  Use the DOS MODE command to change the data
	format.
-p	Change the parity: N (none), O (odd), E (even), S (space) or
	M (mark).  Default is None.
-r	Use raw mode.  Default is cooked mode.
-s	Change the number of stop bits: 1 or 2.  Default is 1.

If a filename list is not specified, data is input from standard input.  If
more than one file name is specified, the contents of all of the files are
transmitted, one at a time, in the order that they have been specified.  The
DOS '*' and '?' wild cards can be used.

The following examples illustrate the calling syntax.  Assume that the
following DOS MODE commands have been issued:

			    MODE COM1:2400,E,7,2
			    MODE COM2:4800,O,8,1

				  Transmit

Transmit all characters typed at the keyboard until a <Ctrl><Z> has been
pressed.  Data is sent over COM1 at 2400 Baud, even parity, 7 data bits and
2 stop bits.  Control characters are ignored.

			    Transmit -2o test.dat

Transmits the contents of the file TEST.DAT.  Data is sent over COM2 at 9600
Baud, no parity, 8 data bits and 1 stop bit due to the override switch. 
Control characters are ignored.

			 Transmit -b1200 *.dat *.doc

Transmits the contents of all files in the current directory that have a
.DAT and a .DOC extension.  Data is sent over COM1 at 1200 Baud, no parity,
8 data bits and 1 stop bit.  Since the Baud rate was changed, the internal
defaults are used for the parity, data bits and stop bits.

			    Transmit -r <test.dat

Transmits the characters piped in from TEST.DAT through standard input. 
Data is sent over COM1 at 2400 Baud, even parity, 7 data bits and 2 stop
bits.  The exact contents of TEST.DAT is transmitted with literal control
characters in raw mode.

In the default cooked mode, control codes are introduced with the '~'
character.  For example, ~M is replaced with a carriage return.  The
following list specifies all of the recognized control codes:

~@ = NUL	~H = BS	 	~P = DLE	~X = CAN	~~ = ~
~A = SOH	~I = HT	 	~Q = DC1	~Y = EM	 	~` = DEL
~B = STX	~J = LF	 	~R = DC2	~Z = SUB
~C = ETX	~K = VT	 	~S = DC3	~[ = ESC
~D = EOT	~L = FF	 	~T = DC4	~\ = FS
~E = ENQ	~M = CR	 	~U = NAK	~] = GS
~F = ACK	~N = SO	 	~V = SYN	~^ = RS
~G = BEL	~O = SI	 	~W = ETB	~_ = US

For example, to transmit:

			   <ESC>3F<FF>Example<CR>

type the following:

			       ~[3F~LExample~M

This eliminates the problems associated with embedding control characters
within a document through a word processor or a text editor.

The Transmit may return the following status codes:
	0	No errors.
	1	Syntax error.
	2	I/O error.
